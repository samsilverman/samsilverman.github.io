        "description": "We introduce NavStick, an audio-based tool for looking around within virtual environments, with the aim of making 3D adventure video games more blind-accessible. NavStick repurposes a game controllerâ€™s thumbstick to allow visually impaired people to survey what is around them via line-of-sight."
